# Stop-Sign-Detection-with-Yolov8
In the modern world, image processing is widely applied across various large-scale applications. To simplify these tasks, many pre-trained models such as YOLO and SSD are available. In this project, YOLOv8 is trained specifically for detecting stop signs.

# Necessary Libraries
The project uses the Ultralytics library, which provides pre-trained YOLO models and convenient tools for training and inference.

# Limitations
YOLO achieves high accuracy in real-world conditions but may be less reliable for tasks requiring highly sensitive measurements. Despite this, it is well-suited for real-time applications due to its speed.
